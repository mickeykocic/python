# python

This repository is for files I create while developing my facility wiht python. I've completed the Runestone Interactive version of _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ and have begun their _Problem-Solving With Algorithms and Data Structures_. I am also going through Zed Shaw's _Python the Hard Way_ and finding it highly helpful. While learning I sometimes also create code snippets or small, simple applications for practice.

These are the directories in the current repository:

<practice> -- for my _PtHW_ practice files
<snippets> -- for code snippets
<in.progress> -- for small, simple applications I am coding
